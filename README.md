# Finances

Collection of scripts to help with personal financial goals.

The scripts are visualization tools for concepts that are harder to grasp on long time frame, like the effects of compound interest in investments and the accumulated inflation over time.

## Installation

Just run the following command

> pip install -r requirements

Optional: create a virtual enviroment for it :)
